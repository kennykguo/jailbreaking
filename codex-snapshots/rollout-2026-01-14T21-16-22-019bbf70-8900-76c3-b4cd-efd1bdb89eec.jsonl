Mach-O and dyld foundations  \n2. Runtime injection & Obj-C control  \n3. ARM64 inline patching  \n4. System-wide instrumentation  \n5. Sandbox & entitlement modeling  \n6. Kernel & Mach IPC tracing  \n7. Secure boot & early kernel modeling  \n8. GPU & deep learning runtime engineering  \n\nCurrent active lab: **LAB 1 – Mach-O Parser**\n\n---\n\n## User Skill Profile\n\nThe user:\n\n• Is fluent in C and low-level systems programming  \n• Understands operating systems, kernels, IPC, memory management  \n• Has GPU, CUDA, FPGA, allocator, and runtime engineering experience  \n• Is new only to Apple’s ecosystem  \n\nNo beginner programming explanations are needed.  \nApple-specific architecture must be explained deeply.\n\n---\n\n## Development Environment\n\nThe user uses both:\n\n| OS | Role |\n|----|-----|\n| Arch Linux | Main build, automation, reproducible systems lab |\n| macOS | Apple-native reference, Mach-O corpus, dyld validation |\n\nAll tooling must:\n\n• Build on both Arch and macOS  \n• Vendor Apple headers under `include/`  \n• Prefer Makefiles  \n• Avoid SDK-locked frameworks  \n• Compile under gcc or clang  \n\n---\n\n## Code Style\n\n• Language: C only  \n• Unix-like small tools  \n• No frameworks, no UI  \n• Explicit memory ownership  \n• Explicit bounds checks  \n• Vendored headers  \n• Portable, reproducible builds  \n\nDirectory style:\n\nrepo/  \n  include/  \n  macho-parser/  \n  … more to come as we finish more labs\n\n---\n\n## Explanation Preferences\n\nExplain in:\n\n• Loader / ABI / kernel / silicon terms  \n• With memory layouts and diagrams  \n• No UIKit / Swift / mobile abstractions  \n• Real binaries, real execution flow  \n\n---\n\n## End Goal\n\nReplace Apple’s ML stack:\n\nCoreML → MPS → Metal → GPU\n\nwith:\n\nUser Runtime → User Metal Kernels → User Memory System → Apple GPU\n\nTurning the iPad into a **custom ARM64 + GPU ML compute node**.\n\n---\n"}}

Mach-O and dyld foundations  \n2. Runtime injection & Obj-C control  \n3. ARM64 inline patching  \n4. System-wide instrumentation  \n5. Sandbox & entitlement modeling  \n6. Kernel & Mach IPC tracing  \n7. Secure boot & early kernel modeling  \n8. GPU & deep learning runtime engineering  \n\nCurrent active lab: **LAB 1 – Mach-O Parser**\n\n---\n\n## User Skill Profile\n\nThe user:\n\n• Is fluent in C and low-level systems programming  \n• Understands operating systems, kernels, IPC, memory management  \n• Has GPU, CUDA, FPGA, allocator, and runtime engineering experience  \n• Is new only to Apple’s ecosystem  \n\nNo beginner programming explanations are needed.  \nApple-specific architecture must be explained deeply.\n\n---\n\n## Development Environment\n\nThe user uses both:\n\n| OS | Role |\n|----|-----|\n| Arch Linux | Main build, automation, reproducible systems lab |\n| macOS | Apple-native reference, Mach-O corpus, dyld validation |\n\nAll tooling must:\n\n• Build on both Arch and macOS  \n• Vendor Apple headers under `include/`  \n• Prefer Makefiles  \n• Avoid SDK-locked frameworks  \n• Compile under gcc or clang  \n\n---\n\n## Code Style\n\n• Language: C only  \n• Unix-like small tools  \n• No frameworks, no UI  \n• Explicit memory ownership  \n• Explicit bounds checks  \n• Vendored headers  \n• Portable, reproducible builds  \n\nDirectory style:\n\nrepo/  \n  include/  \n  macho-parser/  \n  … more to come as we finish more labs\n\n---\n\n## Explanation Preferences\n\nExplain in:\n\n• Loader / ABI / kernel / silicon terms  \n• With memory layouts and diagrams  \n• No UIKit / Swift / mobile abstractions  \n• Real binaries, real execution flow  \n\nIn parallel with implementation, provide first-principles, verbose explanations\nof what is being done and define the terms used. Write these explanations to a\nmarkdown file in the active lab folder (e.g., `macho-parser/EXPLANATION.md` for\nLab 1).\n\n---\n\n## End Goal\n\nReplace Apple’s ML stack:\n\nCoreML → MPS → Metal → GPU\n\nwith:\n\nUser Runtime → User Metal Kernels → User Memory System → Apple GPU\n\nTurning the iPad into a **custom ARM64 + GPU ML compute node**.\n\n---\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The work focuses on a Mach-O parser that can:\\n\\n- Select slices in FAT (universal) binaries.\\n- Map segments and sections.\\n- Resolve dylib dependencies.\\n- Map entrypoints.\\n- Handle 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O.\\n\\nThe implementation lives in `macho-parser/macho_inspect.c`.\\n\\n## 1) Mach-O and FAT from first principles\\n\\n### Mach-O\\nMach-O (Mach Object) is the native binary format used by Apple platforms. A\\nMach-O file starts with a fixed-size header followed by a list of load\\ncommands. The load commands describe how the kernel and dyld (the dynamic\\nlinker/loader) should map the file into memory and what dependencies or\\nmetadata it has.\\n\\nAt a minimum:\\n\\n- The header identifies the file as Mach-O and declares the CPU type and the\\n  number/size of load commands.\\n- Load commands tell the loader which segments to map, which dynamic libraries\\n  to load, and where execution should begin.\\n\\n### FAT / Universal binaries\\nA FAT (universal) binary is a wrapper that contains multiple Mach-O slices for\\nmultiple CPU types. Each slice is its own Mach-O file.\\n\\nThe FAT file starts with a `fat_header`, then a table of `fat_arch` or\\n`fat_arch_64` entries. Each entry says:\\n\\n- CPU type + subtype\\n- File offset to that slice\\n- Size of that slice\\n\\nSo the FAT file is a directory of embedded Mach-O files.\\n\\n## 2) Endianness and magic numbers\\n\\nThe first 4 bytes are the magic number. They determine:\\n\\n- Whether the file is Mach-O or FAT\\n- Whether the byte order is swapped (big-endian vs little-endian)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- `MH_MAGIC_64` / `MH_CIGAM_64` for 64-bit Mach-O\\n- `MH_MAGIC` / `MH_CIGAM` for 32-bit Mach-O\\n- `FAT_MAGIC` / `FAT_CIGAM` for FAT\\n\\nWhen the magic is a swapped variant (CIGAM), all multi-byte fields in the\\nheader and load commands must be byte-swapped to be interpreted correctly.\\n\\n## 3) Headers and load commands\\n\\nBoth 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O headers contain:\\n\\n- CPU type\\n- File type (executable, dylib, bundle, etc.)\\n- `ncmds`: number of load commands\\n- `sizeofcmds`: total size of the load command region\\n\\nLoad commands are a packed array right after the header:\\n\\n```\\n+---------------------------+\\n| Mach-O header             |\\n+---------------------------+\\n| load_command #0           |\\n+---------------------------+\\n| load_command #1           |\\n+---------------------------+\\n| ...                       |\\n+---------------------------+\\n```\\n\\nEach load command starts with:\\n\\n- `cmd`: the type (LC_SEGMENT_64, LC_LOAD_DYLIB, etc.)\\n- `cmdsize`: the size of the command\\n\\nThe parser walks these commands, bounds-checks each command by `cmdsize`, and\\nprints meaning-specific details when the command type is recognized.\\n\\n## 4) Segment and section mapping\\n\\n### Segments\\nA segment is a contiguous region of virtual memory the loader maps from the\\nfile. The segment command describes:\\n\\n- `vmaddr` / `vmsize`: virtual address range\\n- `fileoff` / `filesize`: file byte range\\n- Memory protections\\n\\nThis establishes the file-to-memory mapping:\\n\\n```\\nfile offset -> memory address\\nvmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (file_offset - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\nIf `vmsize` is larger than `filesize`, the extra memory is zero-filled (BSS).\\n\\n### Sections\\nSegments contain sections. A section is a named subdivision (e.g. `__text`,\\n`__data`, `__cstring`). The parser prints each section's address, size, file\\noffset, alignment, and flags.\\n\\nBy printing both segments and sections, we get a complete map of how bytes on\\nstorage turn into addressable memory ranges in a process.\\n\\n## 5) Dylib dependency resolution\\n\\nDynamic libraries are recorded using `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`,\\n`LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB`, and `LC_ID_DYLIB`.\\n\\nEach of these commands contains a `dylib_command` with:\\n\\n- A string offset (relative to the command) for the path\\n- Compatibility and current version numbers\\n\\nThe parser now prints each dylib path and its versions, which is the raw\\ninformation dyld uses to load dependencies and enforce ABI compatibility.\\n\\nIt also prints `LC_RPATH` and `LC_LOAD_DYLINKER`/`LC_ID_DYLINKER` so the search\\npaths and linker identity are visible.\\n\\n## 6) Entrypoint mapping\\n\\nThere are two ways a Mach-O can declare its entrypoint:\\n\\n- `LC_MAIN`: modern, preferred. Contains `entryoff` (file offset) and\\n  `stacksize`.\\n- `LC_UNIXTHREAD`: legacy. Contains a serialized CPU thread state; the PC (program\\n  counter) is the entrypoint.\\n\\nThe parser records `entryoff` and then maps it to a virtual address using the\\nsegment table:\\n\\n```\\nentry_vmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (entryoff - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\nIf a `LC_UNIXTHREAD` command contains an ARM64 thread state, the parser also\\nextracts the `pc` and reports it as an entrypoint.\\n\\nThis produces an explicit mapping from file offset -> VM address, which is the\\nreal execution address inside a process after dyld mapping.\\n\\n## 7) FAT slice selection\\n\\nThe tool now supports explicit FAT slice selection:\\n\\n- `--list` prints all slices in a FAT file.\\n- `--slice N` picks a specific slice index.\\n- `--arch NAME|CPU` picks a slice by CPU type (e.g. `arm64`).\\n\\nIf no selection is provided, the parser prefers ARM64 when available, otherwise\\nfalls back to the first slice. This gives deterministic, explicit control over\\nwhich architecture is inspected.\\n\\n## 8) What changed in the parser\\n\\nKey behavior added to `macho_inspect`:\\n\\n- 32-bit Mach-O parsing (headers, load commands, segments/sections).\\n- Byte-swapped Mach-O support (MH_CIGAM / MH_CIGAM_64).\\n- Dylib dependency and rpath output.\\n- Segment + section mapping with explicit fileoff/vmaddr details.\\n- Entrypoint mapping from LC_MAIN and ARM64 LC_UNIXTHREAD.\\n- FAT slice listing and selection via CLI.\\n\\nThis now covers all Lab 1 artifacts:\\n\\n- Mach-O parser\\n- FAT / universal slice selector\\n- Segment and load-command mapper\\n- Dylib dependency resolver\\n- Entrypoint mapper\\n\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/home/kennykguo/jailbreaking\"}","call_id":"call_xVci4g0z5KZ0Es3eNJ0TpPpL"}}

The work focuses on a Mach-O parser that can:\n\n- Select slices in FAT (universal) binaries.\n- Map segments and sections.\n- Resolve dylib dependencies.\n- Map entrypoints.\n- Handle 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O.\n\nThe implementation lives in `macho-parser/macho_inspect.c`.\n\n## 1) Mach-O and FAT from first principles\n\n### Mach-O\nMach-O (Mach Object) is the native binary format used by Apple platforms. A\nMach-O file starts with a fixed-size header followed by a list of load\ncommands. The load commands describe how the kernel and dyld (the dynamic\nlinker/loader) should map the file into memory and what dependencies or\nmetadata it has.\n\nAt a minimum:\n\n- The header identifies the file as Mach-O and declares the CPU type and the\n  number/size of load commands.\n- Load commands tell the loader which segments to map, which dynamic libraries\n  to load, and where execution should begin.\n\n### FAT / Universal binaries\nA FAT (universal) binary is a wrapper that contains multiple Mach-O slices for\nmultiple CPU types. Each slice is its own Mach-O file.\n\nThe FAT file starts with a `fat_header`, then a table of `fat_arch` or\n`fat_arch_64` entries. Each entry says:\n\n- CPU type + subtype\n- File offset to that slice\n- Size of that slice\n\nSo the FAT file is a directory of embedded Mach-O files.\n\n## 2) Endianness and magic numbers\n\nThe first 4 bytes are the magic number. They determine:\n\n- Whether the file is Mach-O or FAT\n- Whether the byte order is swapped (big-endian vs little-endian)\n\nExamples:\n\n- `MH_MAGIC_64` / `MH_CIGAM_64` for 64-bit Mach-O\n- `MH_MAGIC` / `MH_CIGAM` for 32-bit Mach-O\n- `FAT_MAGIC` / `FAT_CIGAM` for FAT\n\nWhen the magic is a swapped variant (CIGAM), all multi-byte fields in the\nheader and load commands must be byte-swapped to be interpreted correctly.\n\n## 3) Headers and load commands\n\nBoth 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O headers contain:\n\n- CPU type\n- File type (executable, dylib, bundle, etc.)\n- `ncmds`: number of load commands\n- `sizeofcmds`: total size of the load command region\n\nLoad commands are a packed array right after the header:\n\n```\n+---------------------------+\n| Mach-O header             |\n+---------------------------+\n| load_command #0           |\n+---------------------------+\n| load_command #1           |\n+---------------------------+\n| ...                       |\n+---------------------------+\n```\n\nEach load command starts with:\n\n- `cmd`: the type (LC_SEGMENT_64, LC_LOAD_DYLIB, etc.)\n- `cmdsize`: the size of the command\n\nThe parser walks these commands, bounds-checks each command by `cmdsize`, and\nprints meaning-specific details when the command type is recognized.\n\n## 4) Segment and section mapping\n\n### Segments\nA segment is a contiguous region of virtual memory the loader maps from the\nfile. The segment command describes:\n\n- `vmaddr` / `vmsize`: virtual address range\n- `fileoff` / `filesize`: file byte range\n- Memory protections\n\nThis establishes the file-to-memory mapping:\n\n```\nfile offset -> memory address\nvmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (file_offset - segment.fileoff)\n```\n\nIf `vmsize` is larger than `filesize`, the extra memory is zero-filled (BSS).\n\n### Sections\nSegments contain sections. A section is a named subdivision (e.g. `__text`,\n`__data`, `__cstring`). The parser prints each section's address, size, file\noffset, alignment, and flags.\n\nBy printing both segments and sections, we get a complete map of how bytes on\nstorage turn into addressable memory ranges in a process.\n\n## 5) Dylib dependency resolution\n\nDynamic libraries are recorded using `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`,\n`LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB`, and `LC_ID_DYLIB`.\n\nEach of these commands contains a `dylib_command` with:\n\n- A string offset (relative to the command) for the path\n- Compatibility and current version numbers\n\nThe parser now prints each dylib path and its versions, which is the raw\ninformation dyld uses to load dependencies and enforce ABI compatibility.\n\nIt also prints `LC_RPATH` and `LC_LOAD_DYLINKER`/`LC_ID_DYLINKER` so the search\npaths and linker identity are visible.\n\n## 6) Entrypoint mapping\n\nThere are two ways a Mach-O can declare its entrypoint:\n\n- `LC_MAIN`: modern, preferred. Contains `entryoff` (file offset) and\n  `stacksize`.\n- `LC_UNIXTHREAD`: legacy. Contains a serialized CPU thread state; the PC (program\n  counter) is the entrypoint.\n\nThe parser records `entryoff` and then maps it to a virtual address using the\nsegment table:\n\n```\nentry_vmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (entryoff - segment.fileoff)\n```\n\nIf a `LC_UNIXTHREAD` command contains an ARM64 thread state, the parser also\nextracts the `pc` and reports it as an entrypoint.\n\nThis produces an explicit mapping from file offset -> VM address, which is the\nreal execution address inside a process after dyld mapping.\n\n## 7) FAT slice selection\n\nThe tool now supports explicit FAT slice selection:\n\n- `--list` prints all slices in a FAT file.\n- `--slice N` picks a specific slice index.\n- `--arch NAME|CPU` picks a slice by CPU type (e.g. `arm64`).\n\nIf no selection is provided, the parser prefers ARM64 when available, otherwise\nfalls back to the first slice. This gives deterministic, explicit control over\nwhich architecture is inspected.\n\n## 8) What changed in the parser\n\nKey behavior added to `macho_inspect`:\n\n- 32-bit Mach-O parsing (headers, load commands, segments/sections).\n- Byte-swapped Mach-O support (MH_CIGAM / MH_CIGAM_64).\n- Dylib dependency and rpath output.\n- Segment + section mapping with explicit fileoff/vmaddr details.\n- Entrypoint mapping from LC_MAIN and ARM64 LC_UNIXTHREAD.\n- FAT slice listing and selection via CLI.\n\nThis now covers all Lab 1 artifacts:\n\n- Mach-O parser\n- FAT / universal slice selector\n- Segment and load-command mapper\n- Dylib dependency resolver\n- Entrypoint mapper\n\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It assumes you already\\nknow low-level systems programming but do not know the Apple ecosystem.\\n\\nGoal of Lab 1: build a Mach-O parser that lets us fully reason about Apple\\nexecutables as loaded into memory by the kernel + dyld. The parser must:\\n\\n- Parse Mach-O headers and load commands.\\n- Parse FAT (universal) containers and select a slice.\\n- Map segments and sections (file layout -> memory layout).\\n- Resolve dylib dependencies from load commands.\\n- Identify entrypoints (where execution begins).\\n\\nThe implementation is in `macho-parser/macho_inspect.c`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 0) Terms used (defined once, then used throughout)\\n\\n- **Mach-O**: The binary file format used by Apple OSes. Equivalent to ELF on\\n  Linux or PE on Windows. It encodes how a file is mapped into memory and\\n  loaded.\\n- **dyld**: The Apple dynamic loader. Similar to `ld-linux.so` on Linux. It\\n  maps Mach-O images, resolves dependencies, and performs runtime fixups.\\n- **Kernel loader**: The kernel portion that initially maps and transfers\\n  control to user executables. It reads Mach-O headers and load commands.\\n- **Load command**: A record inside Mach-O that tells the loader how to map\\n  segments, which dylibs to load, where the entrypoint is, etc.\\n- **Segment**: A contiguous range of virtual memory that maps to a range in\\n  the file (plus optional zero-filled memory). Think of a PT_LOAD segment in\\n  ELF.\\n- **Section**: A named subdivision inside a segment (e.g. `__text`, `__data`).\\n  Sections are how linkers group code/data. The loader uses segments; sections\\n  are mostly link-time metadata.\\n- **FAT / universal**: A container that wraps multiple Mach-O slices for\\n  multiple CPU types in a single file.\\n- **Slice**: One Mach-O binary inside a FAT container.\\n- **Entrypoint**: The first instruction executed in a new process.\\n- **Endianness**: Byte order in multi-byte values. Mach-O can be stored in\\n  swapped (big-endian) form for some historical platforms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1) What a Mach-O file looks like (from storage to memory)\\n\\nA Mach-O file is a structured blob:\\n\\n- A **header** at offset 0 that identifies the file type and CPU.\\n- A **load command list** immediately after the header.\\n- The **segments** and **sections** described by those commands.\\n\\nMemory mapping (conceptually):\\n\\n```\\nFile bytes:  [ header ][ load commands ][ segment data ... ]\\nMemory map:  [ segments mapped at vmaddr ranges, with permissions ]\\n```\\n\\nThe kernel and dyld read the load commands to know which parts of the file to\\nmap into memory and how to interpret them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) FAT (universal) binaries\\n\\nA FAT file is just a directory of slices.\\n\\n- The FAT header lists how many slices exist.\\n- Each slice has: CPU type, offset, size, and alignment.\\n\\nSo the parser must:\\n\\n1) Read the FAT header.\\n2) Enumerate slices.\\n3) Pick one slice and parse it as a normal Mach-O file.\\n\\nWe added support for:\\n\\n- `--list` to print all slices.\\n- `--slice N` to pick an index.\\n- `--arch NAME|CPU` to pick by CPU type (e.g. `arm64`).\\n\\nDefault behavior prefers ARM64 if available, otherwise the first slice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) Endianness and magic numbers\\n\\nThe first 4 bytes are the **magic** number. It answers two questions:\\n\\n1) Is this Mach-O or FAT?\\n2) Is the byte order swapped?\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- `MH_MAGIC_64` / `MH_CIGAM_64`: 64-bit Mach-O, normal or swapped.\\n- `MH_MAGIC` / `MH_CIGAM`: 32-bit Mach-O, normal or swapped.\\n- `FAT_MAGIC` / `FAT_CIGAM`: FAT container, normal or swapped.\\n\\nIf the magic is a swapped variant, every multi-byte field must be byte-swapped\\nwhen read. This is why the parser uses helper functions to read 32-bit and\\n64-bit values with a `swapped` flag.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) Load commands (the core of Mach-O)\\n\\nLoad commands are a sequential list of structures. Each begins with:\\n\\n- `cmd`: the command type (e.g. `LC_SEGMENT_64`).\\n- `cmdsize`: total size of the command record.\\n\\nThe parser walks them by advancing `p += cmdsize` and bounds-checks each one to\\navoid overrun.\\n\\nKey command types used in Lab 1:\\n\\n- **LC_SEGMENT / LC_SEGMENT_64**: segment mapping and sections.\\n- **LC_LOAD_DYLIB / LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB / LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB / LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB**:\\n  dependency list.\\n- **LC_ID_DYLIB**: identity of a dylib file.\\n- **LC_RPATH**: runtime search paths for dylibs.\\n- **LC_LOAD_DYLINKER / LC_ID_DYLINKER**: which dynamic loader to use.\\n- **LC_MAIN**: modern entrypoint descriptor.\\n- **LC_UNIXTHREAD / LC_THREAD**: legacy entrypoint via thread state.\\n- **LC_UUID**: unique identifier of the binary.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) Segment mapping (file -> memory)\\n\\nA segment says: \\\"map file bytes at this offset into memory at this address.\\\"\\n\\nFields (64-bit example):\\n\\n- `vmaddr`, `vmsize`: virtual address range.\\n- `fileoff`, `filesize`: file range.\\n- `initprot`, `maxprot`: memory permissions.\\n\\nMapping formula:\\n\\n```\\nvmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (file_offset - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\nIf `vmsize > filesize`, the tail of the segment is zero-filled (BSS). That is\\nhow uninitialized data appears in memory without taking space on disk.\\n\\nThe parser prints each segment and records it in a small table so we can map\\nentrypoint offsets to virtual addresses.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6) Sections (linker metadata inside segments)\\n\\nSections divide segments into named regions (`__text`, `__data`, `__cstring`,\\n`__objc_*`, etc.). Sections are primarily for linkers and debuggers, but they\\nhelp us understand where code and data live.\\n\\nThe parser prints, for each section:\\n\\n- Section name and segment name.\\n- Address and size.\\n- File offset.\\n- Alignment and flags.\\n\\nThis gives us a fine-grained memory map of the Mach-O image.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7) Dylib dependencies (what dyld will load)\\n\\nDylibs are the Apple shared libraries (`.dylib` or framework binaries). The\\nload commands list what the binary depends on and how dyld should locate them.\\n\\nEach dylib command contains:\\n\\n- A string offset to the library path (relative to the command start).\\n- Compatibility and current version numbers.\\n\\nWe parse and print:\\n\\n- `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`, `LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB`,\\n  `LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB` for dependencies.\\n- `LC_ID_DYLIB` for a dylib's own identity.\\n- `LC_RPATH` for runtime search prefixes.\\n- `LC_LOAD_DYLINKER` / `LC_ID_DYLINKER` for the loader path.\\n\\nThis is the raw dependency graph input for dyld.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8) Entrypoint mapping (where execution starts)\\n\\nTwo possibilities:\\n\\n### LC_MAIN (modern)\\n\\n- `entryoff`: file offset from the start of the Mach-O file.\\n- `stacksize`: initial stack reservation.\\n\\nWe map `entryoff` to a VM address using the segment table:\\n\\n```\\nentry_vmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (entryoff - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\n### LC_UNIXTHREAD (legacy)\\n\\nThis command embeds a machine-specific thread state. For ARM64, the program\\ncounter (`pc`) is the entrypoint. We parse that state if present and report\\n`pc` directly.\\n\\nThis gives us an exact address inside the process where execution begins.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9) What the code does (walkthrough by function)\\n\\n`macho_inspect.c` is structured around these functions:\\n\\n- `bswap32_u`, `bswap64_u`, `read32_u`, `read64_u`:\\n  Byte-swap helpers to safely interpret swapped-endian Mach-O fields.\\n- `cpu_type_name`, `parse_cputype`:\\n  Map CPU type values to human-readable names and parse `--arch`.\\n- `lc_name`:\\n  Map load command numbers to readable names.\\n- `parse_thin_macho_32`:\\n  Parse a 32-bit Mach-O header, walk load commands, print segments, sections,\\n  dylibs, rpaths, dyld path, UUID, and entrypoint mapping.\\n- `parse_thin_macho_64`:\\n  Same as above but for 64-bit structures and 64-bit offsets.\\n- `parse_fat`:\\n  Parse the FAT header, list slices, pick a slice, then dispatch to 32-bit or\\n  64-bit parsing based on the slice magic.\\n- `main`:\\n  Parse CLI arguments, read the file into memory, detect Mach-O vs FAT, then\\n  call the appropriate parser.\\n\\nImportant safety checks:\\n\\n- Every load command is bounds-checked by `cmdsize`.\\n- Every slice is bounds-checked by `offset + size`.\\n- Each segment's section table size is checked before iterating.\\n\\nThese checks prevent malformed inputs from causing out-of-bounds reads.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10) What we found (current tool output semantics)\\n\\nWhen you run `macho_inspect`, you get:\\n\\n- A clear list of load commands with sizes and types.\\n- Segment mappings (file offset -> vmaddr ranges).\\n- Section lists with names, addresses, and offsets.\\n- Dylib dependencies and rpaths that dyld will use.\\n- Entry point mapped into VM address space.\\n- FAT slice selection and listing.\\n\\nThis gives you enough raw data to reason about:\\n\\n- The address space layout of a binary.\\n- Where code vs data live in memory.\\n- Which dynamic libraries will be loaded and how dyld will find them.\\n- Exactly where execution begins.\\n\\nThat is the minimum foundation for later labs (runtime injection, patching,\\ntracing, and loader manipulation).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 11) How to use the tool (examples)\\n\\nBasic usage:\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect <mach-o file>\\n```\\n\\nList FAT slices:\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect --list <fat file>\\n```\\n\\nPick a slice by index:\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect --slice 1 <fat file>\\n```\\n\\nPick a slice by arch:\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect --arch arm64 <fat file>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 12) Lab 1 completion checklist\\n\\n- Mach-O parser: done\\n- FAT / universal slice selector: done\\n- Segment and load-command mapper: done\\n- Dylib dependency resolver: done\\n- Entrypoint mapper: done\\n\\nLab 1 is complete and provides the parsing foundation for all later labs.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/home/kennykguo/jailbreaking\"}","call_id":"call_zITXxXAzf821Z9EQlHJw4iJ8"}}

It assumes you know low-level systems\\nprogramming in general, but *nothing* about Apple’s ecosystem. The goal is\\nmaximum clarity, even if it feels repetitive.\\n\\nLab 1 objective: build a tool that can fully parse Apple executables (Mach-O\\nfiles), so we can reason about how Apple code is laid out on disk and how it is\\nmapped into memory at runtime. This is the foundation for later labs.\\n\\nThe tool we built is `macho-parser/macho_inspect.c`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1) What is Mach-O? (and why we care)\\n\\n**Mach-O** stands for *Mach Object* file format. It is Apple’s equivalent of:\\n\\n- **ELF** on Linux\\n- **PE** on Windows\\n\\nIt is the standard binary format used on macOS and iOS. Every executable,\\nshared library, and bundle you run on Apple systems is a Mach-O file.\\n\\nWhy it matters: if you want to understand how Apple programs start, load\\nlibraries, and map memory, you must understand Mach-O. This is the “native\\nassembly language” of Apple’s userland runtime.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Mach-O is Apple’s binary\\nformat, analogous to ELF/PE, and all later labs depend on being able to parse\\nit correctly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) What is a FAT / universal binary?\\n\\n**FAT** (also called **universal**) is a container format Apple uses to ship\\none file that supports multiple CPU architectures. Example: a single binary\\nthat runs on both Intel x86_64 and Apple ARM64.\\n\\nA FAT file is *not* a single executable. It is a wrapper that contains multiple\\nindependent Mach-O files, called **slices**. Each slice is a full Mach-O for a\\nspecific CPU type.\\n\\nSo a FAT file is like a directory:\\n\\n- FAT header says how many slices exist.\\n- Each slice entry says: CPU type, file offset, size.\\n\\nOur parser must:\\n\\n1) Read the FAT header.\\n2) List slices (if asked).\\n3) Pick one slice and parse it as a normal Mach-O.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** FAT/universal binaries are\\ncontainers for multiple Mach-O slices; you must select a slice before parsing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) Apple’s loader and linker vocabulary (dyld, linker, loader, dylib)\\n\\nThis is Apple-specific terminology and is easy to confuse. Here is the mapping:\\n\\n### Loader vs linker (general concepts)\\n\\n- **Linker**: A build-time tool that combines object files and libraries into a\\n  final executable. On Apple, the main linker is `ld` (like on Linux), but it\\n  emits Mach-O.\\n- **Loader**: The runtime component that maps an executable into memory and\\n  starts it. On Linux, this is `ld-linux.so`. On Apple, this is **dyld**.\\n\\n### dyld\\n**dyld** is Apple’s *dynamic loader*. It is the runtime program that:\\n\\n- Maps Mach-O segments into memory.\\n- Loads dependent shared libraries.\\n- Applies fixups and relocations.\\n- Transfers control to the program’s entrypoint.\\n\\n### dylib\\nA **dylib** is Apple’s shared library format. It is similar to a `.so` on Linux\\nor a `.dll` on Windows. Dylibs are Mach-O files themselves, but with a file\\nheader that marks them as “shared libraries.”\\n\\n### dyld vs kernel loader\\nOn Apple systems, the kernel does an initial minimal mapping of the main\\nexecutable, then passes control to dyld, which completes loading (dependencies,\\nfixups, etc.). So dyld is a userland loader layered on top of the kernel.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:**\\n- Linker = build-time; loader = runtime.\\n- dyld is Apple’s runtime loader.\\n- dylib is Apple’s shared library file.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) Mach-O file structure from first principles\\n\\nAt a high level, a Mach-O file has:\\n\\n1) A **header** that identifies the file and CPU type.\\n2) A list of **load commands** (metadata for the loader).\\n3) The **segment data** (actual bytes for code and data).\\n\\n### The header\\nThe header tells you:\\n\\n- The CPU type (e.g., ARM64).\\n- The file type (executable, dylib, etc.).\\n- How many load commands exist.\\n- The total size of the load commands.\\n\\n### Load commands\\nA **load command** is a structure that tells the loader what to do. Examples:\\n\\n- Map a segment into memory.\\n- Load a dylib dependency.\\n- Define the entrypoint.\\n\\nEach load command has:\\n\\n- `cmd`: a numeric type.\\n- `cmdsize`: how big this command is.\\n\\nThe loader walks this list and executes the instructions described by each\\ncommand. Our parser does the same, but only prints the information.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Mach-O is header + load\\ncommands + data. Load commands are the “instructions” the loader follows.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) Endianness and magic numbers\\n\\n**Endianness** is byte order. Some Mach-O files are stored in big-endian\\n(swapped) order. The “magic number” at the file start tells you whether the\\nvalues are normal or swapped.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- `MH_MAGIC_64`: 64-bit Mach-O, normal byte order.\\n- `MH_CIGAM_64`: 64-bit Mach-O, swapped byte order.\\n- `FAT_MAGIC`: FAT container, normal.\\n- `FAT_CIGAM`: FAT container, swapped.\\n\\nWhen the magic indicates swapped order, every multi-byte field must be byte-\\nswapped. This is why the parser uses `read32_u` and `read64_u` helpers.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Magic numbers are the file\\nsignature; they tell us Mach-O vs FAT and whether to byte-swap.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6) Segments (the loader’s actual mapping units)\\n\\nA **segment** is the unit the loader maps into memory. Each segment describes:\\n\\n- **Virtual address range** in memory (`vmaddr`, `vmsize`).\\n- **File byte range** on disk (`fileoff`, `filesize`).\\n- **Permissions** (read/write/execute).\\n\\nMapping rule:\\n\\n```\\nvmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (file_offset - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\nIf `vmsize > filesize`, the extra memory is zero-filled. This is how BSS (zero-\\ninitialized data) appears without taking disk space.\\n\\nOur parser prints each segment and records it, because we later need segments to\\nmap the entrypoint offset to a real virtual address.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Segments define how the file\\nmaps into memory; they are the core of the loader’s work.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7) Sections (linker-level organization)\\n\\nA **section** is a named subdivision inside a segment. Examples:\\n\\n- `__text`: machine code.\\n- `__data`: initialized data.\\n- `__bss`: zero-initialized data.\\n\\nSections are mostly for linkers, debuggers, and tooling. The loader uses\\nsegments, not sections. But sections are useful for understanding where code\\nand data live inside a segment.\\n\\nOur parser prints sections to give you a fine-grained map of memory.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Sections are link-time\\nsubdivisions inside segments; useful for analysis but not the loader’s unit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8) Dylib dependencies (what dyld will load)\\n\\nMach-O files list their dynamic dependencies using load commands:\\n\\n- `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`: required dylib.\\n- `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`: optional dylib (load if present).\\n- `LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB`: re-exported symbols.\\n- `LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB`: special lookup semantics.\\n- `LC_ID_DYLIB`: the identity of the dylib file itself.\\n\\nEach of these commands contains a path string to the dylib. This path is what\\n**dyld** uses to locate and load the library at runtime. The command also stores\\nversion numbers used for compatibility checks.\\n\\nWe also parse:\\n\\n- `LC_RPATH`: runtime search prefixes.\\n- `LC_LOAD_DYLINKER` / `LC_ID_DYLINKER`: which dynamic loader is in use.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** The dylib load commands are\\nliterally the dependency list dyld uses at runtime.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9) Entrypoints (where execution begins)\\n\\nThere are two ways a Mach-O defines its entrypoint:\\n\\n### 9.1 LC_MAIN (modern)\\n\\n- `entryoff`: file offset to the entry function.\\n- `stacksize`: requested stack size.\\n\\nWe convert `entryoff` to a virtual address using the segment mapping table:\\n\\n```\\nentry_vmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (entryoff - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\n### 9.2 LC_UNIXTHREAD (legacy)\\n\\nThis command encodes a CPU thread state. For ARM64, the program counter (`pc`)\\ninside that thread state is the entrypoint. We parse and print it if present.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Entrypoint mapping converts\\nfile offsets into actual runtime addresses; this is how we know where code starts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10) What our code does (explicit walkthrough)\\n\\nThis is how the parser is structured:\\n\\n- `parse_fat`: reads FAT headers, lists slices, selects one by index or arch,\\n  then dispatches to `parse_thin_macho_32` or `parse_thin_macho_64` based on the\\n  slice’s magic.\\n\\n- `parse_thin_macho_32`: parses 32-bit Mach-O header, load commands, segments,\\n  sections, dylibs, rpaths, dyld path, UUID, and entrypoints.\\n\\n- `parse_thin_macho_64`: same as above for 64-bit files.\\n\\n- Helpers like `read32_u`, `read64_u` ensure swapped-endian correctness.\\n\\n- A small segment table is collected so we can map `entryoff` to `vmaddr`.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** The parser walks exactly the\\nsame metadata the loader uses, but in a safe, read-only way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 11) What we learned (findings from the tool)\\n\\nFrom `macho_inspect` output you can now see:\\n\\n- Which segments exist, their memory ranges, and their file offsets.\\n- Which sections contain code or data.\\n- Which dylibs will be loaded and from where.\\n- The exact entrypoint address as it will exist in memory.\\n- Which architecture slice you are parsing in a FAT file.\\n\\nThis is the minimal foundation for all later labs (runtime injection, patching,\\ntracing, and loader manipulation).\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** You can now translate a\\nMach-O file into a full memory map and dependency graph.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 12) How to use the tool (examples)\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect <mach-o file>\\n```\\n\\nList slices in a FAT file:\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect --list <fat file>\\n```\\n\\nPick a slice by index:\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect --slice 1 <fat file>\\n```\\n\\nPick a slice by arch:\\n\\n```\\n./macho_inspect --arch arm64 <fat file>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 13) Lab 1 completion checklist\\n\\n- Mach-O parser: done\\n- FAT / universal slice selector: done\\n- Segment and load-command mapper: done\\n- Dylib dependency resolver: done\\n- Entrypoint mapper: done\\n\\nLab 1 is complete.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/home/kennykguo/jailbreaking\"}","call_id":"call_eXfz0capTtMv9auWANzc3ajO"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It assumes you understand general\\noperating systems concepts, but you are new to Apple’s ecosystem.\\n\\nLab 2 goal: gain live control of a running process by injecting a dynamic\\nlibrary and intercepting Objective-C method calls at runtime.\\n\\nArtifacts required by Lab 2:\\n\\n- Minimal dylib injector\\n- Obj-C method interceptor\\n- Runtime tracer\\n- Live return-value patcher\\n\\nAll of these are implemented in the `runtime-injection/` folder.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1) New Apple-specific terms (defined explicitly)\\n\\n### Mach-O (from Lab 1, repeated here)\\nMach-O is Apple’s executable format. Everything we inject or load is a Mach-O\\nfile.\\n\\n### dylib\\nA **dylib** is a dynamic library on Apple systems. It is like a shared library:\\ncode that can be loaded into a running process. A dylib is itself a Mach-O\\nfile with a special file type.\\n\\n### dyld\\n**dyld** is Apple’s dynamic loader. It is the runtime component that maps\\nMach-O files into memory and resolves their dependencies. It is responsible for\\nloading dylibs into a process.\\n\\n### Objective-C runtime (Obj-C runtime)\\nThe **Objective-C runtime** is the system library that implements the\\nObjective-C language’s dynamic features. It owns the class registry, method\\nlookup, and message dispatch. It allows us to replace method implementations at\\nruntime.\\n\\n### Selector (SEL)\\nA **selector** is the runtime representation of a method name. In Objective-C,\\nmethods are looked up by selector (not by direct function pointer).\\n\\n### IMP\\nAn **IMP** is a function pointer to a method implementation. If you replace an\\nIMP, you effectively replace the method’s code at runtime.\\n\\n### Message dispatch (`objc_msgSend`)\\nObjective-C does not call methods directly. Instead, it sends a **message** to\\nan object using `objc_msgSend`. The runtime looks up the selector in the\\nobject’s class and then calls the corresponding IMP. If you change the IMP, you\\nchange what happens when the message is sent.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** dyld loads dylibs; the\\nObjective-C runtime lets us replace methods at runtime by swapping IMPs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) Lab 2 architecture (what we built)\\n\\nWe created three small programs:\\n\\n1) **target** (`target.c`)\\n   - A minimal process that creates an Objective-C class at runtime and calls\\n     a method on it.\\n\\n2) **hook** (`hook.c` compiled into `hook.dylib`)\\n   - A dylib that replaces the method implementation, logs calls (tracing), and\\n     changes the return value (patching).\\n\\n3) **injector** (`injector.c`)\\n   - A minimal launcher that starts the target with a dylib injected using\\n     `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`.\\n\\nThis gives us:\\n\\n- **Injection**: the dylib is injected at process start.\\n- **Interception**: the dylib replaces a method’s IMP.\\n- **Tracing**: the replacement logs inputs/outputs.\\n- **Patching**: the replacement changes the return value.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** these three pieces are the\\nminimal system to gain runtime control of a process using dyld + Obj-C runtime.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) How injection works on Apple (in plain terms)\\n\\nOn Apple systems, dyld decides which dylibs to load when a process starts. One\\nsupported mechanism is an environment variable called:\\n\\n- `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`\\n\\nIf this variable is set, dyld loads the listed dylibs *before* running the\\nprogram’s `main` function.\\n\\nIn our injector:\\n\\n- We spawn the target program.\\n- We add `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=<path-to-hook.dylib>` to the child’s\\n  environment.\\n- dyld loads the hook dylib before the program starts.\\n\\n**Important limitation:**\\n\\n- Apple blocks this for system-protected or “hardened” binaries. This is\\n  enforced by code signing and SIP (System Integrity Protection). That is why\\n  we inject into our own local test program, not into system binaries.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** the minimal injection path\\nis to start a process with DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES so dyld loads your dylib.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) The target program (why it exists and what it does)\\n\\nThe target program is a simple executable that creates an Objective-C class at\\nruntime (using C-only code). This avoids requiring Objective-C source files\\nwhile still exercising the Obj-C runtime.\\n\\nKey steps in `target.c`:\\n\\n1) **Create a class** using `objc_allocateClassPair`.\\n2) **Add a method** named `compute:` with an IMP (`compute_impl`).\\n3) **Register the class** so it exists in the runtime.\\n4) **Create an instance** and call the method using `objc_msgSend`.\\n\\nWe also look for an injected symbol called `hook_install`. If it exists (because\\nour dylib is injected), we call it before sending the message. This makes the\\nhook installation explicit and reliable.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** the target creates a known\\nmethod at runtime so the hook can replace it. The `hook_install` call provides\\nreliable timing for the demo.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) The hook dylib (method interception + tracing + patching)\\n\\nThe injected dylib provides a function called `hook_install`:\\n\\n- It finds the class `RTTarget` in the Obj-C runtime.\\n- It finds the method `compute:`.\\n- It replaces the method’s IMP with `hooked_compute`.\\n\\n`hooked_compute` does three things:\\n\\n1) Logs the input (`x`). (This is the runtime tracer.)\\n2) Calls the original implementation. (So we can see real behavior.)\\n3) Patches the return value to `1337`. (This is the return-value patcher.)\\n\\nThis demonstrates exactly how Obj-C method interception works:\\n\\n- You are not patching machine code directly yet.\\n- You are swapping the function pointer the runtime uses to call the method.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Objective-C methods are\\nindirect calls through the runtime; swapping an IMP is the core interception\\nmechanism.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6) The injector (minimal dylib injector)\\n\\nThe injector is a very small launcher:\\n\\n- It checks that the dylib and target are accessible.\\n- It sets the DYLD environment variables for the child.\\n- It spawns the target process with those variables.\\n\\nThis is not “inject into an already-running process.” It is *start-time\\ninjection*. That is intentional because it is the simplest reliable form on\\nmodern macOS without special entitlements.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** start-time injection via\\ndyld is the simplest way to load your code into a process on Apple systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7) What the output should look like (what we learn)\\n\\nIf you run the target normally, you should see:\\n\\n- `compute_impl` called.\\n- result = 42.\\n\\nIf you run with the injector, you should see:\\n\\n- The hook logging the call.\\n- The original method still running.\\n- The returned value patched to 1337.\\n\\nThis demonstrates that:\\n\\n- Your code is running inside the target process.\\n- You can intercept method calls.\\n- You can observe and modify behavior at runtime.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** the injected dylib has full\\ncontrol over Obj-C method calls in the process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8) Build and run (macOS)\\n\\nFrom `runtime-injection/`:\\n\\n```\\nmake\\n./target\\n./injector ./hook.dylib ./target\\n```\\n\\nExpected behavior:\\n\\n- Without injection, result is 42.\\n- With injection, result is 1337 and hook logs appear.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9) Arch Linux support (build-only)\\n\\nThe code builds on Arch, but the injection is not functional there because:\\n\\n- There is no dyld on Arch.\\n- There is no Apple Objective-C runtime by default.\\n\\nSo on Arch you can compile, but you cannot run the injection demo. This is\\nintentional to keep the repo cross-platform and allow editing/building on Arch.\\n\\n**What you should understand after this section:** Lab 2 runtime behavior\\nrequires macOS, but the codebase remains buildable on Arch.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10) Lab 2 completion checklist\\n\\n- Minimal dylib injector: done (`injector`)\\n- Obj-C method interceptor: done (`hook_install` + IMP swap)\\n- Runtime tracer: done (hook logs inputs/outputs)\\n- Live return-value patcher: done (return 1337)\\n\\nLab 2 is complete.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/home/kennykguo/jailbreaking\"}","call_id":"call_ZiCzpmwkuA7catqsMWxKbK94"}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted. Approvals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. `approval_policy` is `on-request`: Commands will be run in the sandbox by default, and you can specify in your tool call if you want to escalate a command to run without sandboxing. If the completing the task requires escalated permissions, Do not let these settings or the sandbox deter you from attempting to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere are scenarios where you'll need to request approval:\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- You are running sandboxed and need to run a command that requires network access (e.g. installing packages)\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with approval. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nWhen requesting approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n  - Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n  - Include a short, 1 sentence explanation for why you need escalated permissions in the justification parameter The writable roots are `/home/kennykguo/jailbreaking`, `/tmp`.</permissions instructions>"}]}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
