Mach-O and dyld foundations  \n2. Runtime injection & Obj-C control  \n3. ARM64 inline patching  \n4. System-wide instrumentation  \n5. Sandbox & entitlement modeling  \n6. Kernel & Mach IPC tracing  \n7. Secure boot & early kernel modeling  \n8. GPU & deep learning runtime engineering  \n\nCurrent active lab: **LAB 1 – Mach-O Parser**\n\n---\n\n## User Skill Profile\n\nThe user:\n\n• Is fluent in C and low-level systems programming  \n• Understands operating systems, kernels, IPC, memory management  \n• Has GPU, CUDA, FPGA, allocator, and runtime engineering experience  \n• Is new only to Apple’s ecosystem  \n\nNo beginner programming explanations are needed.  \nApple-specific architecture must be explained deeply.\n\n---\n\n## Development Environment\n\nThe user uses both:\n\n| OS | Role |\n|----|-----|\n| Arch Linux | Main build, automation, reproducible systems lab |\n| macOS | Apple-native reference, Mach-O corpus, dyld validation |\n\nAll tooling must:\n\n• Build on both Arch and macOS  \n• Vendor Apple headers under `include/`  \n• Prefer Makefiles  \n• Avoid SDK-locked frameworks  \n• Compile under gcc or clang  \n\n---\n\n## Code Style\n\n• Language: C only  \n• Unix-like small tools  \n• No frameworks, no UI  \n• Explicit memory ownership  \n• Explicit bounds checks  \n• Vendored headers  \n• Portable, reproducible builds  \n\nDirectory style:\n\nrepo/  \n  include/  \n  macho-parser/  \n  … more to come as we finish more labs\n\n---\n\n## Explanation Preferences\n\nExplain in:\n\n• Loader / ABI / kernel / silicon terms  \n• With memory layouts and diagrams  \n• No UIKit / Swift / mobile abstractions  \n• Real binaries, real execution flow  \n\n---\n\n## End Goal\n\nReplace Apple’s ML stack:\n\nCoreML → MPS → Metal → GPU\n\nwith:\n\nUser Runtime → User Metal Kernels → User Memory System → Apple GPU\n\nTurning the iPad into a **custom ARM64 + GPU ML compute node**.\n\n---\n"}}

Mach-O and dyld foundations  \n2. Runtime injection & Obj-C control  \n3. ARM64 inline patching  \n4. System-wide instrumentation  \n5. Sandbox & entitlement modeling  \n6. Kernel & Mach IPC tracing  \n7. Secure boot & early kernel modeling  \n8. GPU & deep learning runtime engineering  \n\nCurrent active lab: **LAB 1 – Mach-O Parser**\n\n---\n\n## User Skill Profile\n\nThe user:\n\n• Is fluent in C and low-level systems programming  \n• Understands operating systems, kernels, IPC, memory management  \n• Has GPU, CUDA, FPGA, allocator, and runtime engineering experience  \n• Is new only to Apple’s ecosystem  \n\nNo beginner programming explanations are needed.  \nApple-specific architecture must be explained deeply.\n\n---\n\n## Development Environment\n\nThe user uses both:\n\n| OS | Role |\n|----|-----|\n| Arch Linux | Main build, automation, reproducible systems lab |\n| macOS | Apple-native reference, Mach-O corpus, dyld validation |\n\nAll tooling must:\n\n• Build on both Arch and macOS  \n• Vendor Apple headers under `include/`  \n• Prefer Makefiles  \n• Avoid SDK-locked frameworks  \n• Compile under gcc or clang  \n\n---\n\n## Code Style\n\n• Language: C only  \n• Unix-like small tools  \n• No frameworks, no UI  \n• Explicit memory ownership  \n• Explicit bounds checks  \n• Vendored headers  \n• Portable, reproducible builds  \n\nDirectory style:\n\nrepo/  \n  include/  \n  macho-parser/  \n  … more to come as we finish more labs\n\n---\n\n## Explanation Preferences\n\nExplain in:\n\n• Loader / ABI / kernel / silicon terms  \n• With memory layouts and diagrams  \n• No UIKit / Swift / mobile abstractions  \n• Real binaries, real execution flow  \n\nIn parallel with implementation, provide first-principles, verbose explanations\nof what is being done and define the terms used. Write these explanations to a\nmarkdown file in the active lab folder (e.g., `macho-parser/EXPLANATION.md` for\nLab 1).\n\n---\n\n## End Goal\n\nReplace Apple’s ML stack:\n\nCoreML → MPS → Metal → GPU\n\nwith:\n\nUser Runtime → User Metal Kernels → User Memory System → Apple GPU\n\nTurning the iPad into a **custom ARM64 + GPU ML compute node**.\n\n---\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/kennykguo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The work focuses on a Mach-O parser that can:\\n\\n- Select slices in FAT (universal) binaries.\\n- Map segments and sections.\\n- Resolve dylib dependencies.\\n- Map entrypoints.\\n- Handle 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O.\\n\\nThe implementation lives in `macho-parser/macho_inspect.c`.\\n\\n## 1) Mach-O and FAT from first principles\\n\\n### Mach-O\\nMach-O (Mach Object) is the native binary format used by Apple platforms. A\\nMach-O file starts with a fixed-size header followed by a list of load\\ncommands. The load commands describe how the kernel and dyld (the dynamic\\nlinker/loader) should map the file into memory and what dependencies or\\nmetadata it has.\\n\\nAt a minimum:\\n\\n- The header identifies the file as Mach-O and declares the CPU type and the\\n  number/size of load commands.\\n- Load commands tell the loader which segments to map, which dynamic libraries\\n  to load, and where execution should begin.\\n\\n### FAT / Universal binaries\\nA FAT (universal) binary is a wrapper that contains multiple Mach-O slices for\\nmultiple CPU types. Each slice is its own Mach-O file.\\n\\nThe FAT file starts with a `fat_header`, then a table of `fat_arch` or\\n`fat_arch_64` entries. Each entry says:\\n\\n- CPU type + subtype\\n- File offset to that slice\\n- Size of that slice\\n\\nSo the FAT file is a directory of embedded Mach-O files.\\n\\n## 2) Endianness and magic numbers\\n\\nThe first 4 bytes are the magic number. They determine:\\n\\n- Whether the file is Mach-O or FAT\\n- Whether the byte order is swapped (big-endian vs little-endian)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- `MH_MAGIC_64` / `MH_CIGAM_64` for 64-bit Mach-O\\n- `MH_MAGIC` / `MH_CIGAM` for 32-bit Mach-O\\n- `FAT_MAGIC` / `FAT_CIGAM` for FAT\\n\\nWhen the magic is a swapped variant (CIGAM), all multi-byte fields in the\\nheader and load commands must be byte-swapped to be interpreted correctly.\\n\\n## 3) Headers and load commands\\n\\nBoth 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O headers contain:\\n\\n- CPU type\\n- File type (executable, dylib, bundle, etc.)\\n- `ncmds`: number of load commands\\n- `sizeofcmds`: total size of the load command region\\n\\nLoad commands are a packed array right after the header:\\n\\n```\\n+---------------------------+\\n| Mach-O header             |\\n+---------------------------+\\n| load_command #0           |\\n+---------------------------+\\n| load_command #1           |\\n+---------------------------+\\n| ...                       |\\n+---------------------------+\\n```\\n\\nEach load command starts with:\\n\\n- `cmd`: the type (LC_SEGMENT_64, LC_LOAD_DYLIB, etc.)\\n- `cmdsize`: the size of the command\\n\\nThe parser walks these commands, bounds-checks each command by `cmdsize`, and\\nprints meaning-specific details when the command type is recognized.\\n\\n## 4) Segment and section mapping\\n\\n### Segments\\nA segment is a contiguous region of virtual memory the loader maps from the\\nfile. The segment command describes:\\n\\n- `vmaddr` / `vmsize`: virtual address range\\n- `fileoff` / `filesize`: file byte range\\n- Memory protections\\n\\nThis establishes the file-to-memory mapping:\\n\\n```\\nfile offset -> memory address\\nvmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (file_offset - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\nIf `vmsize` is larger than `filesize`, the extra memory is zero-filled (BSS).\\n\\n### Sections\\nSegments contain sections. A section is a named subdivision (e.g. `__text`,\\n`__data`, `__cstring`). The parser prints each section's address, size, file\\noffset, alignment, and flags.\\n\\nBy printing both segments and sections, we get a complete map of how bytes on\\nstorage turn into addressable memory ranges in a process.\\n\\n## 5) Dylib dependency resolution\\n\\nDynamic libraries are recorded using `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`,\\n`LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB`, `LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB`, and `LC_ID_DYLIB`.\\n\\nEach of these commands contains a `dylib_command` with:\\n\\n- A string offset (relative to the command) for the path\\n- Compatibility and current version numbers\\n\\nThe parser now prints each dylib path and its versions, which is the raw\\ninformation dyld uses to load dependencies and enforce ABI compatibility.\\n\\nIt also prints `LC_RPATH` and `LC_LOAD_DYLINKER`/`LC_ID_DYLINKER` so the search\\npaths and linker identity are visible.\\n\\n## 6) Entrypoint mapping\\n\\nThere are two ways a Mach-O can declare its entrypoint:\\n\\n- `LC_MAIN`: modern, preferred. Contains `entryoff` (file offset) and\\n  `stacksize`.\\n- `LC_UNIXTHREAD`: legacy. Contains a serialized CPU thread state; the PC (program\\n  counter) is the entrypoint.\\n\\nThe parser records `entryoff` and then maps it to a virtual address using the\\nsegment table:\\n\\n```\\nentry_vmaddr = segment.vmaddr + (entryoff - segment.fileoff)\\n```\\n\\nIf a `LC_UNIXTHREAD` command contains an ARM64 thread state, the parser also\\nextracts the `pc` and reports it as an entrypoint.\\n\\nThis produces an explicit mapping from file offset -> VM address, which is the\\nreal execution address inside a process after dyld mapping.\\n\\n## 7) FAT slice selection\\n\\nThe tool now supports explicit FAT slice selection:\\n\\n- `--list` prints all slices in a FAT file.\\n- `--slice N` picks a specific slice index.\\n- `--arch NAME|CPU` picks a slice by CPU type (e.g. `arm64`).\\n\\nIf no selection is provided, the parser prefers ARM64 when available, otherwise\\nfalls back to the first slice. This gives deterministic, explicit control over\\nwhich architecture is inspected.\\n\\n## 8) What changed in the parser\\n\\nKey behavior added to `macho_inspect`:\\n\\n- 32-bit Mach-O parsing (headers, load commands, segments/sections).\\n- Byte-swapped Mach-O support (MH_CIGAM / MH_CIGAM_64).\\n- Dylib dependency and rpath output.\\n- Segment + section mapping with explicit fileoff/vmaddr details.\\n- Entrypoint mapping from LC_MAIN and ARM64 LC_UNIXTHREAD.\\n- FAT slice listing and selection via CLI.\\n\\nThis now covers all Lab 1 artifacts:\\n\\n- Mach-O parser\\n- FAT / universal slice selector\\n- Segment and load-command mapper\\n- Dylib dependency resolver\\n- Entrypoint mapper\\n\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/home/kennykguo/jailbreaking\"}","call_id":"call_xVci4g0z5KZ0Es3eNJ0TpPpL"}}
